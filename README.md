# ♟️ Chess AI Next Move Calculator

**Chess AI Next Move Calculator** is a focused desktop utility built for one purpose: to tell you what the best next move is. Whether you're stuck in a tricky position, teaching someone the ropes, or just curious if your idea holds up, this tool cuts through the noise and delivers a clean, engine-backed answer.

## 🤖 What Is This?

This is not a full-featured chess platform. It's a streamlined calculator that connects your board to powerful chess AI. You set up the position, and the engine instantly calculates the strongest continuation. Think of it as a second opinion you can trust—available anytime, without the clutter of full-blown chess software.
